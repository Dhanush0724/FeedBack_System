  - **Strengths**
  - **Areas of improvement**
  - **Overall sentiment** (positive / neutral / negative)
- Managers can submit, edit, and view feedback
- Employees can acknowledge feedback
- Feedback history available

### 📊 Dashboard

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 🔁 1. Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/Dhanush0724/FeedBack_System.git

cd FeedBack_System

🖥️ Frontend Setup (Angular)

cd frontend
# Install dependencies
# npm install 
 if any error in dependency conflict check
use this = npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start the development server
# ng serve
 --📍 App runs at: http://localhost:4200

# 🐍 Backend Setup (FastAPI)

cd backend

🐳 Run Backend via Docker
Ensure Docker is installed and running:

# Build Docker image
docker build -t feedback-backend .

# Run container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 feedback-backend

# Now check the frontend link to access application running on : http://localhost:4200

# Optinal if Docker not available 
In Case if you don't want to use docker
skips the docker part and continue
Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload
📍 Backend runs at: http://localhost:8000

# make sure you are running both backend and frontend at two seperate terminal for smooth communication

# 🎨 Design Decisions
FastAPI was chosen for its speed, type safety, and ease of building APIs with Python.

Angular provides structure, modularity, and strong form handling with built-in guards for routing and role-based UI display.

JWT-based authentication ensures a secure, stateless session management system.

SQLite is used for development simplicity. The backend can be easily adapted to PostgreSQL for production.

Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures secure and private feedback viewing/editing.

The system is Dockerized for consistent backend setup across environments.
